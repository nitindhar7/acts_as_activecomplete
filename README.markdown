Usage
=====

Setup
-----

Add the acts_as_activecomplete helper method for each model that you wish to enable autocompletion on. This helper method also
accepts parameters, each of which is a column, that will be used for autocompletion.

    class Product
        acts_as_activecomplete :name, :description
    end

After the initial setup, run

    rake activecomplete:build:words['Product']

The 'build:words' rake task create a words index for the given models' columns. Currently, only one model per task is accepted, however this will be changed
very soon.

     rake activecomplete:build:correlations['Product']

The 'build:correlations' rake task create a correlations index for the given model. Each consecutive tuple of words will be recorded and metrics will be stored.
